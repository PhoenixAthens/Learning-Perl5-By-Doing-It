Q1:: How does this statement work in Perl? `open(INPUT,$fileName) or die("$fileName not found");`

A:: Itâ€™s utilizing **short-circuit logic**! If the `open()` function is able to open the file successfully, the expression on the left-hand side (LHS) of `or` returns `TRUE`, and the expression on the right-hand side (RHS) is not executed. Thus, the `die` subroutine is never called!

However, if the `open` function is unable to open the file for whatever reason, the expression on the LHS of `or` returns `FALSE`, and the expression isnâ€™t short-circuited. This results in the `die` subroutine being executed, which terminates our program before any harm can be done!

Q2:: What's the meaning of `<INPUT>` in the while-loop? How does it work?

A:: Well, I did some research (AMZN Q ðŸ˜…), so it goes something like this:<br>
- The `<INPUT>` construct is a file input operator that reads a single line from the file associated with the `INPUT` file-handle.
- Each time the loop iterates, the next line from the file is read and stored in the variable on the LHS of `=` sign.
- The loop continues until the end of the file is reached, at which point `<INPUT>` will return `undef`, causing the loop to exit.
> FYI: the `<input>` construct will read the `\n` at the end of each line as well, so no need to add `\n` at the end of `print` message string!

Q3:: How does this expression `$cl =~ / help /` in the while-loop work?

A:: Well, glad you asked!. This is how we check each line to see if there is a match for word `help` in it. The `/ help /` is a very basic regular-expression. 
You can read the expression `if($cl =~ / help /)` as, check if the line contained in `$cl` has a value that can be captured by the regular expression `/ help /`. You can adjust this regular expression like so `/help/`, to not only match the word `help` but words such as `helpless`, `helping`, etc. as well, that contain the letter `help` in order.

Q4:: What's the purpose of `$|=1` at `ln4`?

A:: Perl buffers the output on `Unix`-based systems. To disable output-buffering we put `$|=1` at the start of our perl script.

Q5:: What's the purpose of `'>'.$outputFile` in statement `open(OUTPUT,'>'.$outputFile) or die("$outputFile couldn't be created!\n");`?

A:: `'>'.$outputFile` is how we concatenate strings in Perl. Like in `Java`, we use the `+` operator to concatenate two strings, in `Perl`, we use the `.` operator to concatenate strings, here them strings being the path to output file `$outputFile` and `>`. The purpose of doing this concatenation is in with regards with how we create files in Perl. To create a file in perl, one must append `'>'` to the beginning of the path to the file. We could've also added `>` to the path like so
`my $outputFile = '>./Resources/output.txt';`, but that would've looked even more ambiguous, thus we went with the convention applied here!

Q6:: What's up with the new regExp in this expression `$currLine =~ /\begg\b/`?

A:: Well, `\b` defines the bounday for our capture-string, with `\b` we are telling the regExp engine how the boundary for the capture group is to be defined, surrounded by `\b` means that out string can be surrounded by a space, hyphen, full-stop, etc, but not by other letters.

Q6:: What's up with this statement `$currLine =~ s/hen/DOG/ig;`>

A:: This statement looks for lines with values that can be captured by `/hen/` and replaces them with `/DOG/` the purpose of `s/` before the first forward-slash is to say that we want to replace values from first capture group with `DOG`, the `i`, and `g` are flags, with `i` standing for `case-insensitive` (thus `hen` ,`HeN`, `HEn`, `HEN`, etc. will all open for capture) and `g` standing for `global` (meaning, replace all occurrences of `hen` with `DOG`, and not just the first one.)

Q6:: What's the meaning of this new `print` statement `print OUTPUT $currLine;`

A:: I get it! It does look like a `syscall` but it's just saying "print to the file held by handler `OUTPUT` the string stored in variable `$currLine`".
