Q1:: How does this statement work in Perl? `open(INPUT,$fileName) or die("$fileName not found");`

A:: Itâ€™s utilizing **short-circuit logic**! If the `open()` function is able to open the file successfully, the expression on the left-hand side (LHS) of `or` returns `TRUE`, and the expression on the right-hand side (RHS) is not executed. Thus, the `die` subroutine is never called!

However, if the `open` function is unable to open the file for whatever reason, the expression on the LHS of `or` returns `FALSE`, and the expression isnâ€™t short-circuited. This results in the `die` subroutine being executed, which terminates our program before any harm can be done!

Q2:: What's the meaning of `<INPUT>` in the while-loop? How does it work?

A:: Well, I did some research (chatGPT ðŸ˜…), so it goes something like this:<br>
- The `<INPUT>` construct is a file input operator that reads a single line from the file associated with the `INPUT` file-handle.
- Each time the loop iterates, the next line from the file is read and stored in the variable on the LHS of `=` sign.
- The loop continues until the end of the file is reached, at which point `<INPUT>` will return `undef`, causing the loop to exit.
