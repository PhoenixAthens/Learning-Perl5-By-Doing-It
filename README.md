# Learning Perl 5 by Doing It!
> I've been seeing Perl here n there for a while now; It's time I understood what the hype is all about!

The use of Perl scripts is ubiquitous in modern technologies! Perl's syntax is un-intuitive yet concise; the language is known for its strong support of `Regular Expressions`. You might have encountered Perl in a bunch of places or even executed a bunch of them unknowingly. For example, remember the time you created a Virtual Machine in Virtual Box and the resolution of the Virtual Machine just wouldn't adjust to the resolution of your desktop? Remember the time you were installing some package using `apt`, `dnf` or `brew`? Yup, here-there-everywhere, we encounter Perl scripts doing their thing; however, we forget to appreciate their usefulness because they crash seldom and the folks tasked with the job of writing Perl scripts don't screw up at that. Kudos to those brilliant devs!

Thanks for reading! See you around!
